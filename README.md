# ThirdYearCodes
This repository contains source code for various projects I completed during my second year of engineering studies in 2024. It covers diverse areas from core subjects:

Projects:

**Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Implementations of neural network architectures (e.g., Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks) for classification, regression, or image recognition tasks (code may utilize libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras).
**R Programming**: Scripts demonstrating data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using the R programming language. This could include data cleaning, statistical modeling, or creating insightful visualizations with packages like ggplot2.
**Machine Learning:** Exploration of machine learning concepts through code for supervised learning (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines), unsupervised learning (e.g., k-means clustering), or reinforcement learning techniques.
**Data Analysis and Visualization:** Code for exploring, analyzing, and cleaning datasets, potentially involving libraries like pandas (Python) or data.table (R) for manipulation, and libraries like Matplotlib (Python) or ggplot2 (R) for creating informative visualizations.
