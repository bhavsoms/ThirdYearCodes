# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
This repository contains code implementations for various concepts related to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

- **Activation Functions:**
Explore different activation functions commonly used in ANNs, such as sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, etc. Code demonstrates how these functions transform input values.

- **Perceptron Learning Rule:**

Implement the Perceptron Learning Rule to train a single neuron for logical operations like AND and OR gates. Code includes examples for both gates, showcasing how the perceptron learns to classify input patterns.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**

Implement a basic SVM classifier using libraries like Scikit-learn. While not strictly an ANN, understanding SVMs is valuable for understanding classification algorithms.

- **Bidirectional Propagation Network (BPN) on Iris Dataset:**

Build and train a BPN for multi-class classification on the Iris flower dataset. Code demonstrates how BPNs learn complex relationships between input features and target classes.

- **Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) Mapping:**

Implement a BAM for pattern association tasks. Code explores how BAMs can store and retrieve paired information through a bidirectional learning process.
